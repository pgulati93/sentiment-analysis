# Sentiment Analysis

This repo contains a project to create a machine learning algorithm to classify the sentiment of sample texts.

The main python script is `text_classify.py`.

This script requires 2 input files:
* `input_files/training.txt`
* `input_files/testdata.txt`)

and produces 1 output file:
* `output_files/testdata_classified.txt`

with the results of classifying sentiment of new (or test) data.

Current accuracy of classifying the train file data is ~97%.
