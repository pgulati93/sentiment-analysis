# Sentiment Analysis

This repo contains a project to create a machine learning algorithm to classify the sentiment of sample texts.

The main python script is `text_classify.py`. This script requires 2 input files (`training.txt` and `testdata.txt`) and produces 1 output file (`testdata_classified.txt`) with the results of classifying sentiment of new (or test) data.

Current accuracy of classifying the train file data is at 97%.
